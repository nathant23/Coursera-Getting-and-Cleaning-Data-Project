It was downloaded at: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

## Files
* CodeBook.md - This is a codebook that describes the variables of the final output of the project, tidyData.txt
* run_analysis.R - Script that processes and transforms the data into a tidy data set.  The script contains comments throughout to describe what was done and why.
